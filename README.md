# conan-gstreamer

Conan build for gstreamer, run the command to build a project.

The build order is as below:

-   gstreamer-build-tools  
    Gstreamer build tools generated by boostrap

-   gstreamer-runtime  
    Gstreamer-1.0 runtime library

-   gstreamer-dev  
    Gstreamer-1.0 development library

-   gstreamer-custom  
    Custom modified libraries, including gst-rtsp-server-1.0, dtls, webrtc

-   libwebstreamer  
    Media processing library for node.js based on gstreamer, might be removed later.

# How to build

## linux
### pre-work
* Gstreamer should be built in the docker `lasote/conangcc49` using gcc4.9. Here's the steps:

```bash
# download the docker image
$ git pull lasote/conangcc49

# the first time to run the image
$ sudo docker run -it lasote/conangcc49 /bin/bash

# or you can use the commands below once you have creaed a container using the command above
$ sudo docker start container_id
$ sudo docker exec -it container_id /bin/bash

# update the environment, it may be very slow and vpn may be required
$ sudo apt-get -y update
$ sudo apt-get -y upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
```


### build
gstreamer-runtime, gstreamer-dev, and gstreamer-custom require dependies. They will use the pre-built package in your own bintray defaultly.   

If you want to use the other pre-built packages, set `DEPENDENT_BINTRAY_REPO` in your environment. `DEPENDENT_BINTRAY_REPO` is the bintray username, if not set, it's same as `CONAN_USERNAME`.


    $ cd $project
    $ sudo python build.py

The gstreamer library will be installed to the directory `~/gstreamer/linux_x86_64`.

If you want to develop your own library based on the gstreamer-1.0, run the commond to load the environment:

    $ cd ~/gstreamer/linux_x86_64
    $ source tshell.sh

## windows

### pre-work

The initial setup on Windows is a little bit longer, but only a few programs are required.

-   Python2.7: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>
     IMPORTANT : Chose the 2.7 version. The 3.x versions are _not_ supported
-   CMake: <http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html>
-   Git: <http://git-scm.com/download/win>
     IMPORTANT: Select the install option "Checkout as-is, Commit as-is"
-   Msys/MinGW: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-setup.exe/download>
       Install it with all the options enabled, you can also select the package below in `Basic Setup` for minimum installation:
       * mingw-developer-toolkit
       * mingw32-base
       * msys-base
    <!-- * WiX 3.5: http://wix.codeplex.com/releases/view/60102 -->
    <!-- * active perl https://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads/thank-you?dl=http://downloads.activestate.com/ActivePerl/releases/5.24.3.2404/ActivePerl-5.24.3.2404-MSWin32-x64-404865.exe -->

<!-- The Direct Show plugins still needs to be built using Microsoft's compiler and their SDK,
due to the dependency on the Direct Show base classes.
You need to install the following software:
  * Microsoft SDK 7.1: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279
  * Windows Driver Kit 7.1.0: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/hh852365 -->

**cerbero must be run in the `MingGW shell`, which is accessible from the main menu or desktop (if it is not, go to Mingw Installation manager, select MSYS Base Development and install msys-bash  lnk).**

The last step is making python and git available from the shell, for which you will need to create a .profile file:

If you use 64-bit Windows, please execute:

    $ echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/c/Python27:/c/Program Files/Git/bin:/c/MinGW/bin/"' > ~/.profile

If you use 32-bit Windows, please execute:

    $ echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/c/Python27:/c/Program Files (x86)/Git/bin:/c/MinGW/bin/"' > ~/.profile

### 64-bit build

    $ export CONAN_ARCHS=x86_64
    $ export CONAN_BASH_PATH="C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin\sh.exe"

    set CONAN_ARCHS=x86_64
    set CONAN_BASH_PATH=C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin\sh.exe
